First person shooter prototype developed in unity editor. Created by Jere Puittinen.

My goal is to learn to make a shooter game prototype using a first person camera. For now, my aim is to create a simple AI for enemies that chase the player and attack back. I also need to create a way for hit detection when firing the gun, which lowers the health value of enemies until the value is below one, which is when the enemies character models are destroyed. I will also create a main menu where the player can select to either quit the game or start a new one. The game should also end when the player's health value goes below one.

I have already made a first person camera, where the camera is attached to the player and moves with the player model. The camera view turns with the computer mouse and moves in the game world with WASD keys.
